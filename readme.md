# DECENTRALIZED CONSENSUS 

# Coding a Crypto-currency from scratch

I am taking a class online to build my own crypto currency from scratrch. From creating the classes to instantiate blocks to hashing the data in each block to connecting wallets to the blockchain, everyhing is being coded from scratch. Here you will find muy current progres. Its all being written in Javascript with the intent to create a React front end to display the blockchain when the project is complete!
